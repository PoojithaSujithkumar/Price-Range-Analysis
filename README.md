💰 Price Range Analysis – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview  
This project was carried out as part of my Data Science Internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**. The focus was to analyze how restaurant pricing correlates with customer ratings and visual rating indicators.

📊 Dataset  
The dataset includes:
- Restaurant price ranges
- Customer ratings
- Rating color indicators

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Workflow  
✅ Identified the most frequent price range among restaurants
